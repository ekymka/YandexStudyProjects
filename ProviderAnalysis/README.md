# Telecom company tariff plans

## Task
Compare two tariff plans, analyse which of them is more profitable for telecom provider.

## Description
Mobile provider offers to its clients two different tariff plans. We have datasets which show how many minutes, data and messages were used by each client. Every client can terminate the contract at any moment without any extra fees. We need to analyse clients' behavior to tell which tariff plan is better for the operator. Also I tested the hypothesis about difference in the revenue of the clients from Moscow and from other regions.
